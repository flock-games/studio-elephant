# White Elephant - Sanity

This project was built in 4(ish) hours for the [Learn With Jason Hackathon 10](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/blog/web-dev-challenge-hackathon-s1e10-workshop-woes).

The challenge was to build an app using [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) to help Santa in the busy Christmas season.

This is a very simple Sanity project based on the default Nuxt template. The primary changes are to specity the schema type I used in the hackathon.

To use your own project, update `sanity.cli.ts` and `sanity.config.ts` with your own `projectId`.

To run:

> npm install

> npm run dev
